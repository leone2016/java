Classes
–	Classes are basic building block of every java program
–	To design a class means to describe parts and characteristics of these blocks
–	In order to use a class you need to create a object (most of the times)
o	You can think about a clkass as a blueprint, and an object as realization
–	An obj is a single representation of the class, also called instances of class
–	A reference is a varuable that points to a obj
Fields and Methods
–	Two main elements (members) of Java classes are fields and methods
–	Fields are sometimes referred to variables
o	To be precise: all fields are variables, but not all varaiable are fields
–	Fields hold the info about the state of an object or class
–	Methods describe some action or operation on that state
o	Methods are similar to function in some older programming languages
```java

class Student { }
// in file Student.java
public class Students {
   String name;
   public String getName(){
        return name;
   }
}
```
