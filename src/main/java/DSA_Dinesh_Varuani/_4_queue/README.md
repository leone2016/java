What is a Queue?
* It is a linear data structure used for storing data. 
* It follows the FIFO (First In First Out) rule. 
* It is similar to the queue we see in our daily life, where the person who comes first is the first person to get the ticket. 
* The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack, we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.
