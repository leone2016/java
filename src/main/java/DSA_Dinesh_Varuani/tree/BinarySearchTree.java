 * class 110
 * How to represent Binary Search Tree in Java?
 *
 * It is a type of Binary tree in wich data is organized in a ordered manner wich helps in fater search and insertion of data. It satisfies following properties:
 *  - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 *  - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 *  - The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
